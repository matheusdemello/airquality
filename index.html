            <p><strong>Communication Objective:</strong> To encourage caregivers, particularly fathers and pregnant women, to implement a set of evidence-based home practices (localized insulation, draft sealing, and targeted ventilation) to lower newborn exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5), thereby reducing the risks of acute lower respiratory infections, low birth weight, and preterm birth.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Benefit/ Promise:</strong> By preparing the "nest," caregivers ensure their newborn breathes cleaner air, “Your baby will breathe cleaner air, grow stronger, and have a healthier, disease-free future.” This promise combines emotional protection (cultural value) with scientific benefit (reduced PM2.5 exposure).</p>
            <p><strong>Desired Action Response:</strong> Before the baby arrives, caregivers will finish a localized "Nest Checklist," which will lead to the changes of the home environment (such as timing ventilation and sealing windows/doors with felt).</p>

              <p>The Falcon’s Nest Symbol of the Ak-shumkar (White Falcon) as the main logo to represent a guardian of the household. Just as the falcon selects high, clean environments for its young, our campaign commands attention by framing the home as a "Nest" that requires intentional construction. This visual metaphor aligns with the UNICEF (2020) and WHO (2023) approach of using culturally resonant symbols to drive community engagement in health behaviors.</p>

              <p>The "Seal &amp; Breathe" Checklist, the message is refined into a three-step Nest Checklist: Seal (Felt), Isolate (Warmth), and Ventilate (Airflow). This addresses the dual challenge in Kyrgyzstan: preventing cold air infiltration while ensuring proper air exchange. Clarifying that ventilation is necessary even in cold weather is crucial to prevent "sick building syndrome," as noted in WHO (2009) guidelines on indoor air quality.</p>

Effective sealing with felt strips and maintaining a stable temperature ensures the home stays above the 18°C threshold recommended for protecting respiratory health (WHO 2018). The secondary benefit is economic, as reduced heat loss directly translates to lower household expenditure on coal or electricity.</p>

              <p>(Tradition Meets Science) The Head (Science): We provide logical proof that sealing drafts with wool-felt can reduce heat loss by up to 25%, a critical factor for families facing energy poverty (ARIS 2020). "We ventilate at 2:00 PM because the air is 30% cleaner than at 8:00 AM" (UNICEF 2022). We seal with felt, and the reason we chose felt is because of the science behind it in helping achieve our campaign goals.</p>

We offer a "Gold Standard" of care by offering the checklist as a tool recommended by UNICEF and WHO data with Kyrgyz Yurt Heritage. It has been proven that this "hybrid" authority, which combines regional traditional materials with global medical data, increases adoption rates in rural Central Asian contexts (UCA 2020).</p>
